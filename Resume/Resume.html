					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
                    <p>I am attending Brigham Young University, where I am pursuing Business and Law. I have worked in retail, hospitality, child-care and customer service. Of all my jobs, working as a volunteer Editor in Chief of my high school newspaper was the most rewarding. This role helped me acquire various writing and designing skills, many of which I have received both state and national recognition for, but also allowed me to connect with a wide range of my community members.</p>
